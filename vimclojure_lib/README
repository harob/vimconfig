This VimClojure+Nailgun set-up is based on the instructions at https://github.com/daveray/vimclojure-easy .

To get everything working:
- Run make in .vim/vimclojure_lib/vimclojure-nailgun-client
- Configure Leiningen 2.0 properly:
    $ cat ~/.lein/profiles.clj
    {:user {:plugins [[lein-tarsier "0.9.2"]]}}
- In a Clojure project, run 
    $ lein vimclojure
- In Vim hit \sr and make sure you get a REPL
